; 1. For each possibility:
;     Go over each element
;     1a. If it's a character, append to all results
;     1b. If it's a list, go to 1 (to get a list of other possibilities)
;     and then append to all results
;     
; The basic case for this is '( (\a) (\b) ) right?
; Should return '("a" "b")
; And '(\a) should return ("a")
; So getting the comination of ("a") to ("a" "b") should give
; ("aa" "ab")
